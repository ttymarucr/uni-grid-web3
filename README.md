# UniGrid: A Decentralized Grid Tool for Uniswap

UniGrid is a decentralized grid trading tool built on top of Uniswap. It empowers users to automate their trading strategies by creating grid-based trading patterns directly on the Uniswap protocol. This tool leverages the power of decentralized finance (DeFi) to provide a transparent, trustless, and efficient way to execute grid trading strategies.

## Purpose

The purpose of UniGrid is to simplify and enhance the trading experience for users of Uniswap by introducing grid trading functionality. Grid trading is a popular strategy that involves placing buy and sell orders at predefined intervals above and below a set price. UniGrid automates this process, allowing users to:

- Maximize profits in volatile markets.
- Minimize manual intervention in trading.
- Take advantage of Uniswap's decentralized liquidity pools.

By building on Uniswap, UniGrid ensures that all trades are executed in a decentralized and permissionless manner, giving users full control over their funds and strategies.

## Features

- **Decentralized Trading**: Fully integrated with Uniswap's decentralized exchange.
- **Automated Grid Strategies**: Create and manage grid trading strategies with ease.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are executed on-chain, ensuring trust and security.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Define grid intervals, price ranges, and order sizes to suit your trading needs.

## Limitations

While UniGrid provides powerful tools for grid trading on Uniswap, there are some limitations to consider:

- **Gas Costs**: Since all transactions are executed on-chain, users may incur significant gas fees, especially during periods of high network congestion.
- **Market Volatility**: Grid trading strategies may not perform well in extremely volatile or illiquid markets, potentially leading to losses.
- **No Guaranteed Profits**: While grid trading can be profitable in certain market conditions, it does not guarantee profits and carries inherent risks.

  - Linear
  - Sigmoid
  - Fibonacci / Bid - Ask
  - Logarithmic
